# MedicalImageToolkit: A comprehensive toolkit for Medical Image Segmentation and Filtering
A C++ library to perform core image filtering and a semi-automatic segmentation through the Connected Component Localization of the Region-Scalable Fitting Energy.

The theory supporting this segmentation procedure is detailed in the following [publication](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2015.7306035):

## Installation
This library is validated on Linux and harnesses the following libraries:

- [cmake](http://www.cmake.org) to construct the MakeFile
- [VTK](http://www.vtk.org) to visualize, to import and to drop 3d images
- [fftw](http://www.fftw.org) to efficiently compute DFT
- [GetPot](http://getpot.sourceforge.net/) to import parameters from a data file

Prior to initiating the installation, all these libraries must
