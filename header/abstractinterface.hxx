 * \brief A pure virtual class conceived as a linker between an \ref image3d
 * and a template \ref imageptr usefull to show, load and save an image.
 *
 * This pure virtual class is conceived as a sort of guide for the progammer.
 * He has to implement all of the abstract members of the class to make the
 * library work. The goal is to have an interface class (the son class)
 * specialized in communication between an \ref image3d and a template \ref
 * imageptr. This template \ref imageptr has to be in a special format in which is
 * easier to show a 3d image on the screen or write it in a file. For all
 * this reasons the son class \ref interface is implemented using
 * vtk libraries. To make the library work without vtk libraries user has to
 * implement itself another son class using an alternative way to implement
 * all abstract members of this class.
