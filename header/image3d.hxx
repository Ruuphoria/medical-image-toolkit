/*!
 \brief A template class conceived as a container of data and typical operations
 of a 3D image.

 This class is a container for data types that can be reassembled to a 3D image
 (mainly in size), making it possible to manipulate them, for instance in an
 algorithm.
 In particular it overloads arithmetic operators and implements various methods
 to access the data in both reading and writing mode.
 The main usage of this class is to represent a three dimensional image or an
 associate function defined on its uniform structured grid of pixels.
 It could be also used to represent a more general 3D signals, for instance a 3d audio
 signal or a video using the third dimension as time.
 It works good also with 2D images or signals if \ref image3d::dimz is set to 1.

 \tparam T is the type of data contained in the class, it can be any kind of number
 variable (int, float, double...) to represent black and white images.

 \warning This class is not conceived to represent RGB images. To make it work with
 RGB images user has to implement an appropriate son class reimplementing most of
 members.

     (the default value 0.5 is suggested), then it extracts all pixels connected with
     white pixels of input image init (every pixels not equal to 0 will be consired
     white from this algorithm).

     \param res is the output image.
     \param init is the input boolean image and has to be of the same dimensions.
     \param threshold indicates the percentage threshold used to divide pixels
     into black
     & white and must be between 0 and 1.
     \param full_connected is a boolean value (default false) that, if it's set true,
     considers connected also pixels sharing only corners. Otherwise pixels are
     considered connected only if they share an edge in 2d or a face in 3d.
     \param binary_output if false (default true) the method return an image equal to the
     original image everywhere exept in the not connected white part of the black and white image.
     In this part the image is set to its minimum.
