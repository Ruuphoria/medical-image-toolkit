 \brief A class to apply a segmentation algorithm consisting on the application of
 the Split-Bregman method to minimize the Region Scalable Fitting Energy Functional.

 This algorithm divides an \ref im3d::image3d into two regions, hence it works good to
 segment images with two clearly defined set of intensity values.
 It works good also with inhomogeneous images thanks to its property of approximation
 of the intensity of the image to segment using convolution with a Gaussian kernel.\n
 More precisely this algorithm minimize the following functional, where \ref phi is
 the levelset function in which the contour of the image is stored and \f$u_0\f$ is
 the intensity function of the image:
 \f[
 \mathcal{F}(\phi(\mathbf{x}))
 \quad=\quad
    \nu~\left\|\nabla \phi \right\|_{g} \quad+\quad
    \left\langle \phi, \lambda_{1}e_{1} - \lambda_{2}e_{2} \right\rangle_{L^2(\Omega)}
 \f]
 \f[
 \mbox{where}\qquad e_i(\mathbf{x})
 \quad=\quad
    \int_{\Omega}
        K_\sigma(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\left| u_0 (\mathbf{x}) -
        f_i(\mathbf{y})\right|^2
    d \mathbf{y},
 \f]
 \f[
 \mbox{with}\qquad
 K_\sigma(\mathbf{x})=
\frac{1}{(\sqrt{2\pi}\ \sigma)^d}\ \exp \left\{ -\frac{|\mathbf{x}|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\},
\quad \mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^d,
\qquad \qquad
 f_{i}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{K_{\sigma} \ast \Big[  M_{i}^{\varepsilon}
 \big(\phi(\mathbf{x})\big) u_{0}(\mathbf{x}) \Big] }
 {K_{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}) \ast M_{i}^{\varepsilon}\big(\phi(\mathbf{x})\big) },
 \f]
 \f[
 M_{1}^{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}
 \left(
    1 + \frac{2}{\pi}\arctan\left(
    \frac{\phi(\mathbf{x})-(a_0 +\alpha)}{\varepsilon|b_0 -a_0|}
    \right)
 \right),
 \qquad \qquad
 M_{2}^{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{x}) = 1 - M_{1}^{\varepsilon}.
 \f]
 \f[
 \|f\|_{g}~=~
    \left\|~g(u_0)~f~\right\|_{L^1(\Omega)}, \qquad
g\big(u_0(\mathbf{x})\big)  ~=~
    \frac{1}{1+\beta\left|edge\_detector\big(u_0(\mathbf{x})\big)\right|^2}.
 \f]
 The behaviour of the algorithm changes with the modification of the parameters
 characterizing the functional. Using the default values is a good starting point, but
 it could be necessary to modify the parameters to obtain a better segmentation.
 To understand better how to modify each parameter see the documentation of each one:
 \ref sigma, \ref lamda, \ref lamda1, \ref lamda2, \ref nu, \ref beta, \ref dt,
 \ref ls_steps, \ref epsilon, \ref a0, \ref b0, \ref alpha.\n
 Another feature of the algorithm is to 'think globally' dividing the whole image into
 two regions. On the contrary, to focus only on a part of the image, you can use
 the automatic extraction of a connected component of the image setting some specific
 parameters (\ref auto_extract_conn_comp, \ref auto_extract_conn_comp_freq).\n
 Also other customization are allowed, see the documentation of all private variables
 for more details.

     * The goal is to compute a function to be multiplied with the module of the
     * gradient in order to make his L1 norm smaller in regions with edges.
     * This function is of the form \f$ g=1\big/(1+\beta\xi) \f$, where \f$\xi\f$ is
     * the edge detector, hence it assumes higher values in regions with edges.
     * The choice of \f$\xi\f$ depends on this variable that can assume three values:
     * GRAD, GRAD_THRESHOLD and LBP.\n
     * GRAD is the default (and suggested) choice that sets
     * \f$\xi=\big|\nabla\phi\big|^2\f$.
     * Most of time this is a good choice because generally edges coincide with
     * regions with high gradient, however in some kind of images
     * (for instance images with really high noise)
     * gradient could be not null also in regions far from edges. To avoid this
     * problem the second values makes a threshold on the gradient using member
     * im3d::image3d::im_to_black_and_white. User can choose the preferred
     * value of the threshold during the beginning of the execution of the algorithm.
     * Note that this choice leads to a \f$\xi\f$ equal to 1 on the 'candidate' edges,
     * 0 otherwise, hence it produces a less efficient g if at the same time \ref beta
     * is not increased properly by the user.\n
     * Both of this two choices can be combined with a Gaussian blur of the images to
     * limit error linked with noise setting \ref edge_detector_sigma with a value
     * different from zero.\n
     * LBP is the last possibility user can choose, but it works only with 2D images.

     * and white image is used member
     * \ref im3d::image3d::local_binary_pattern_edge_detector instead of the gradient.
