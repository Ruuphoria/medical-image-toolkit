 \brief A template functor conceived to filter an \ref im3d::image3d with a previously
 chosen filter using convolution.

 This class implements various ways to do various kinds of convolution between an
 \ref im3d::image3d that the user can pass directly to the functor and an assigned
 filter saved in static members of the class in both time and frequency version.\n
 First of all, the user has to decide what kind of filter he'd like to build choosing
 from those available (using the related static function). All implemented filters are
 real and even.\n
 Then he can construct a functor choosing the kind of convolution desired. He can
 choose between aperiodic discrete convolution (both in frequency or time domain) and
 periodic discrete convolution (in frequency domain).
 Convolution in frequency domain uses fast
 fourier transform algorithm, thus is more efficient if desired filter is of relatively
 big dimension (see more details on function documentation
 \ref acyclic_fftw_convolution).
 The user can also implement by himself his own version of convolution
 (exploiting static filters) passing it to the class constructor.\n
 Some example of usage of class \ref filtering are shown in file
 \ref image_toolkit.cxx.

 \warning It's important to remember that before using functor on a new
 \ref im3d::image3d with different dimensions than the first one, the user has to
 rebuild filters (or at least
 frequency filters, if he doesn't want to change time filter).
 Check \ref build_freq_filters static functions for more details.

 \note This functor could filter also bidimensional images, in this case the user has
 to pass to the functor an \ref im3d::image3d with \ref im3d::image3d::dimz equal to 1.

 \tparam T is the same template parameter of the \ref im3d::image3d to filter and it
 characterizes also the filters built inside the class. It could be any kind of
 floating number.
 Integer number (for instance int or unsigned int) are not allowed, hence if you
 want to filter an \ref im3d::image3d with T=int you have to transform it
 (before passing it to the functor) in an \ref im3d::image3d with T equal to a
 floating number type using im3d::image3d::operator = ().

    /*!
     \brief Static member to store the time version of the filter.

     The kind of filter stored in this member depends on what related static
     function has been called to build it. However, every kind of \ref time_filter
     has got some common properties:\n
     -# It's real and even and therefore its number of elements is odd.
     This ensures that also its fourier transform is real and even.\n
     -# The middle position in each direction represents the zero of the cartesian
     axis. Hence its maximum value is usually (not necessarily) in the middle position.

     Since this member is public, the user can directly initialize it as he likes.
     He has only to respect the two proprerties just shown to ensure a proper
     functioning of the functor.

     \brief Static member to store the frequency version of the filter used to perform
     cyclic convolution.

     In this member the fourier transform of the time filter is stored.
     Since fft considers the value in the first position on each direction as the zero
     of the cartesian axes, before performing fft, the negative part of time filter
     is shifted at the end of a local vector.\n
     Dimensions of the filter are equal to the dimensions of the convolution factor or
     to an integer multiple of it if \ref time_filter is bigger than factor.
     (Check \ref cyclic_fftw_convolution documentation for more details.)
     Therefore, between the positive and negative parts of the time filter are added
     as many zeros as needed to reach these dimensions.
     All these actions are performed by \ref build_freq_filters function.

    /*!
     \brief Static member to build static filters as a Gaussian kernels.

     This member builds the \ref time_filter as a Gaussian kernel and automatically
     calls the \ref build_freq_filters member to build the corrisponding
     \ref cycl_freq_filter and \ref acycl_freq_filter (note that the Fourier transform
     of a Gaussian kernel is still a Gaussian kernel with a different sigma).
     Have a look at \ref image_toolkit.cxx file for an example of usage.

     \param f is the factor you'd like to filter and is passed to this function only
     to get its size and spacing.
     \param sigma is the standard deviation of the time domain Gaussian kernel
     (in pixel).
     \param radius is a parameter to indicate the distance, as multiples of sigma,
     in which the Gaussian kernel could be considered null.
     Default value is equal to 3. If you want to improve accuracy make it greater,
     if you want to decrease computational costs make it smaller (not too small!).
     \param pixel_approach is a boolean variable that changes way of building the
     gaussian kernel. If it is set to false (default) this member considers spacing
     between pixels to build kernel, hence it builds a \ref time_filter with bigger
     dimensions if spacing of factor f are smaller
     (because you need more pixels to obtain a kernel of a certain radius if spacing
     are smaller) and viceversa. On the contrary, if it
     is set to true it doesn't care about spacing of the factor and it builds a
     \ref time_filter considering spacing equal to 1 in each direction.
     Hence, this alternative way allows user to make a gaussian blur based on number
     of pixels.
     \warning this member builds a discrete version of a continous Gaussian kernel,
     for a good approximation of the continous one is suggested to use sigma greater
     than 3*h (where h is the smallest spacing between \ref im3d::image3d::hx,
     \ref im3d::image3d::hy and \ref im3d::image3d::hz of the factor to convolve).
     By the way, to ensure that convolving with this continuous kernel is a
     "good mean operation", norm1 of \ref filtering::time_filter is manually set to
     one.
